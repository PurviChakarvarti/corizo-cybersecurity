# Pentesting on ColdBox

## Abstract
The "Pentesting on ColdBox" project was initiated to assess the security of a ColdBox application and identify potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and session fixation. The goal was to recommend actionable mitigation strategies and improve the overall security posture of the application.

## Introduction
ColdBox is a CFML framework for building web applications. Despite its built-in security features, vulnerabilities can still arise. This project aims to identify and address those vulnerabilities through a combination of automated scanning and manual testing.

## Testing Methodology
- **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering about the ColdBox application and its attack surfaces.
- **Scanning**: Using tools to detect vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS.
- **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting**: Documenting findings and suggesting fixes.

## Findings
We identified three key vulnerabilities:
1. SQL Injection
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Session Fixation

## Conclusion
The project provided valuable insights into the security of ColdBox applications and helped reduce risks by recommending fixes for vulnerabilities. Ongoing testing is recommended for maintaining security.
